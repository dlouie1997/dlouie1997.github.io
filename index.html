					<p>As someone who has toyed around on websites since middle school, it has always been fun to see the different types of websites I could create. Giving each and everyone their own personality, feeling, and style was something I enjoyed, even if was on website builders that did most of the work for you. Now a days, I'm learning how to hard code websites, gaining more control over how the sites looks, and being able to make it look exactly as I want it to.</p>
					
					<p>In addition to using HTML and CSS (with basic and in training knowledge of JavaScript), I am also familiar with many Adobe products. Some of my strengths are video editing in Premiere Pro, manipulating photos in Photoshop, using VScode and basical terminal commands, and building emails from a mockup, like in Adobe XD. I am familiar with using Monday, Slack, Teams and other similar applications. I have knowledge in Illustrator, components (what you see is what you get), and am actively learning&nbsp;Figma.</p>

					<p>I also have a passion for video editing and would love to try and learn and grow in that industry where possible.</p>
